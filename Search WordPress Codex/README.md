# Search WordPress Codex
#### [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)

## About
This is a Sublime Text 2 plugin allowing you to easily search the WordPress Codex. 

Most of all it let's you right-click on any WordPress function and select 'WordPress Function Reference' to open the Codex page for *this* function.

The plugin code is based on the [Stackoverflow Plugin](https://github.com/ericmartel/Sublime-Text-2-Stackoverflow-Plugin) script by Eric Martel.

## Usage
ctrl + shift + P and type `WordPress Codex`, or right click on any function and select 'WordPress Function Reference'.

You can also select 'WordPress Codex Search' to search tje whole codex for the selected text.

## Install

### Package Control

The easiest way to install this is with [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime\_packages/package\_control).

 * If you just went and installed Package Control, you probably need to restart Sublime Text 2 before doing this next bit.
 * Bring up the Command Palette (Command+Shift+p on OS X, Control+Shift+p on Linux/Windows).
 * Select "Package Control: Install Package" (it'll take a few seconds)
 * Select WordPress Codex when the list appears.

Package Control will automatically keep Git up to date with the latest version.

If you have some problems or improvements with it, contact me via GitHub.
